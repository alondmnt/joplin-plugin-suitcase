# Suitcase ðŸ§³

This Joplin plugin adds text capitalization options to the Markdown and rich text editors. In the menu `Edit --> Capitalization` you will find 6 commands that can be applied after selecting text:

- lower case
- UPPER CASE
- Title Case (based on [title-case](https://www.npmjs.com/package/title-case))
- Sentence case
- ï½†ï½•ï½Œï½Œï½—ï½‰ï½„ï½”ï½ˆ
- halfwidth

In addition, Suicase provides a command that allows sorting lines in a case-insensitive manner.
